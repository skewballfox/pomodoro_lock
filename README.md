# Pomodoro lock

this is a program that locks the screen after a decided upon length of time (currently 25 minutes), and prevent the user from logging in for a decided length of time (currently 3 minutes). The fourth time the script is run without a long pause between lock and unlock the break is extended to 5 times the normal break. if the user doesn't unlock within 15 minutes of the screen being locked, the counter is reset.

## Getting Started

as long as you have python3 and bash you shouldn't need to install anything. I'll add more here as I develop the script a bit more.
